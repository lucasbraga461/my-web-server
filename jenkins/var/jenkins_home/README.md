This folder `jenkins/var/jenkins_home` is used in the `docker-compose.yaml` to sync with the container's files so that it saves the configurations that you set up in jenkins as you use it.  
This is important so that you don't lose the configurations and jobs that you've created in jenkins everytime that you turn the containers down.
